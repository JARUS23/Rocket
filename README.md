### About

* The aim of this project was not to create an optimized working game but to get good understanding of how games work internally.
* For the Graphical User Interface (GUI) it uses Swing API.
* The game runs on CPU. It does not require GPU.
* For playing music it uses jaco-mp3-player library. The .jar file can be found under res folder.
